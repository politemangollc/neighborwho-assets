Terms of Service

Last updated: 03/06/2023

Please read this End-User License Agreement ("Agreement") carefully before using the NeighborWho (the "Service"), operated by Polite Mango LLC.

By using the Service, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not use the Service.

We reserve the right to update and change, from time to time, the terms and conditions of this Agreement without notice to you. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.

Tolerance for Objectionable Content and Abusive Users

The Service may not be used to upload, post, transmit, or otherwise distribute any content that is or could be considered offensive, abusive, or harmful to any individual or group. This includes, but is not limited to, content that is racist, sexist, or sexually explicit in nature.

We have a zero-tolerance policy for any user who engages in behavior that is considered abusive or in any way harmful to other users. If we receive reports of such behavior, we will take appropriate action. Please note that NeighborWho does not allow users to create accounts. If we receive reports of abusive or harmful behavior, we will use the device ID of the offending user to ban them from using our app. Banned users will not be able to access our app using the same device and will need to obtain a new one to regain access. Our goal is to create a safe and welcoming environment for all users, and we take any violation of our policies seriously.

Termination of Service

We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the Service at any time, with or without cause or notice, for any reason or no reason. We also reserve the right to refuse service to any individual or entity, at any time, with or without cause or notice, for any reason or no reason.

Limitation of Liability

In no event shall Polite Mango LLC, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
